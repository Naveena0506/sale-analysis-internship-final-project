My project is about performing Exploratory data analysis using python and I chose jupyter note books as my ide for performing exploratory data analysis.Eda is a process of visually and statistically summarising exploring and making sense of the main characteristics of a data set.

I began eda by importing necessary python librariess such as pd,np,plt & sns. 1.1NUMPY :Np( numerical py ) is a fundamental package for scientific computing with py .it provides support for large multidimensional arrays &matrices along with a collection of high level mathematical functions 1.2 PANDAS :Pd is a powerful data manipulation &analysis lib.provides data structures like df & series 1.3 MATPLOTLIB :Matplotlib is a popular data visualisation lib.provides a collection of functions that allows us to create &customise various types of plots& visualisations such as line plot,scatter plots bar charts & histograms .it is commonly used for creating 2d graphics & data visualisation 1.4 SEABORN: Sns is a data visualisation lib based on matplotlib designed for statistical graphics.it simplifies by creating informative & attractive statistical graphs 2.Next I have loaded dataset into pd df using command pd.read_csv which is used in py with pd lib to read data from CSV &store in df 3.Thn I have made intial examination of data using commans like df. head,df .info,df.describe and df.shape .df.shape gave me dimensions in the form of tuple with no of rows & columns which is useful for understanding size & structure of df for manipulation & analysis df.head is used to display frst few rows of a df which is a 2d tabular data structure df.info is a method to get info abt df .provides summary abt df like no of non null values in each c ,data type of each c ,memory usage of df,total no of r&c .it is useful for understanding structure & contents ,allows to check missing values of each c which is imp for preprocessing & analysis 4.Thn I performed data cleaning using df.dropna /df.fillna to remove null values and df drop_duplicates()
